## 📌 About the Project

In a world where real estate prices fluctuate like the weather, wouldn't it be amazing to **predict the future of housing prices with data**?

This project dives into **residential housing data** and leverages **machine learning** to forecast property prices with clarity and confidence.

More than a model — this is a story told by numbers.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

Housing isn’t just a transaction.  
It’s family. It’s future. It’s freedom.

That's why I wanted to **go beyond just algorithms** and explore the *story behind the price tags*.

- What makes one home worth $100,000 more than another?
- Which features silently boost value?
- How can data help families make smarter choices?

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

From messy data to meaningful predictions — here's what went down:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Outlier detection & removal

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Selected impactful features
   - Used domain knowledge to enrich dataset

3. **Modeling**
   - Trained multiple regression models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge & Lasso
     - Random Forest

4. **Evaluation**
   - Compared RMSE, R², MAE
   - Final model chosen based on generalization and performance

5. **Deployment (Upcoming)**
   - Planning to wrap this into a Streamlit dashboard for public use

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- ML Models: Linear, Lasso, Ridge, RF
- GitHub for version control

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **OverallQual** was the most powerful predictor — even more than square footage.
- Garage size and neighborhood added surprising predictive power.
- Outliers drastically skewed model accuracy until they were handled.
